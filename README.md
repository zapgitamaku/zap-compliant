# Welcome to ZapAPI!

## Welcome to ZapAPI

The ZAP API is built around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational\_state\_transfer). Our API uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs, accepts request bodies that have been [encoded using a form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST\_\(HTTP\)#Use\_for\_submitting\_web\_forms), and returns responses that have been [encoded using JSON.](http://www.json.org/)

## Want to jump right in?

Feeling like an eager beaver? Jump into the quick start docs and get making your first request:

{% content-ref url="quick-start/" %}
[quick-start](quick-start/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Want to deep dive?

Dive a little deeper and start exploring our API reference to get an idea of everything that's possible with the API:

{% content-ref url="reference/api-reference.md" %}
[api-reference.md](reference/api-reference.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
