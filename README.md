# Welcome To Zap Business

## Welcome to Zap Business API

The Zap Business API is built around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational\_state\_transfer). Our API uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs, accepts request bodies that have been [encoded using a form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST\_\(HTTP\)#Use\_for\_submitting\_web\_forms), and returns responses that have been [encoded using JSON.](http://www.json.org/)
